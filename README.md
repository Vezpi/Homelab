# 🧪 Homelab

> ⚠️ **Work in Progress** – This repository is actively evolving as I automate and expand my homelab.

Welcome to my homelab repository! This is where I manage and document the infrastructure powering my personal lab environment using modern DevOps tools and best practices.

## 🚀 Goals

- Automate VM and infrastructure deployment with **Terraform**
- Configure systems and services using **Ansible**
- Deploy and manage Kubernetes with **Flux CD** using a **GitOps** approach
- Keep everything **declarative**, **reproducible**, and **version-controlled**

## 📌 Notes

This repository is intended for **educational and experimental purposes**. Feel free to explore, fork, and adapt ideas for your own homelab setup.
